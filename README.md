# BeerOverflowWindowsApp

Rate pubs and bars on how much beer they pour in. 
The end product should fetch GPS coordinates, then get a list of bars nearby. User then chooses a bar and, on a slider, defines how much beer was poured in. Project might possibly use computer vision to automatically find out how much of the glass is filled.
